Some examples:\n","\n","* __Too Narrow:__  What is the GDP of the U.S. for 2011?  This is just asking for a fact or a single data point.  \n","\n","* __Too Broad:__  What is the primary reason for global poverty?  This could be a Ph.D. thesis and would still be way too broad.  What data will you use to answer this question?  Even if a single dataset offered an answer, would it be defendable given the variety of datasets out there?\n","\n","* __Good:__  Can you use simple sentiment analysis on comments about movies in a movie database to predict its box office earnings?

You will not be graded on the complexity, accuracy or performance of your analytical methods.
